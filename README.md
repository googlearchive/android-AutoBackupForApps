Android Automatic Backup Sample
===================================

Sample demonstrating how to selectively disable Automatic
          Backups in Android M, either by adjusting the location where data
          files are stored or by using a custom XML configuration file.

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how to selectively disable Automatic Backups in Android M, either by
adjusting the location where data files are stored using [getNoBackupFilesDir()][1], or by using a
custom XML configuration file.

This sample can also be used as a utility to test the behavior of the Automatic Backup feature.
Executing:

    adb shell bmgr restore com.example.android.autobackup

from a terminal will cause the sample's data to be cleared and replaced with a copy from the backup
server.
